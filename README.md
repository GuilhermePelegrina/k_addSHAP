## Introduction

This work addresses local interpretability in machine learning based on Shapley values. Firstly, we provide a straightforward formulation of a SHAP-based method for local interpretability by using the Choquet integral, which leads to both Shapley values and Shapley interaction indices. Moreover, we also adopt the concept of $k$-additive games from game theory, which contributes to reduce the computational effort when estimating the SHAP values.
